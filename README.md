### Business Introduction
The retail and consumer goods industry is a highly competitive landscape where customer preferences, campaign effectiveness, and purchasing channels play a crucial role in determining market success. Mavenâ€™s Campaign Analysis dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of marketing performance, customer behavior, and purchasing trends.

### Business Problem
"How can Maven better align its marketing efforts with customer demographics and preferences to maximize purchases and campaign ROI?"

### Objective of The Analysis
The primary objective of this analysis is to understand the impact of various marketing campaigns, customer demographics, and product preferences on purchase behavior. It aims to optimize marketing strategies by identifying high-performing segments and underutilized opportunities.

### Data Transformation and Analysis
To conduct this analysis, data was collected and aggregated across multiple customer interaction points including campaign participation, purchase channels, product categories, and demographics such as age, country, marital status, and education.
The process involved:
1.	Data Cleaning & Transformation: Raw data was preprocessed to remove inconsistencies, categorize variables (e.g., Age Group, Education Level), and convert data into analyzable formats.
2.	Data Aggregation: Key metrics such as total purchases, number of customers, website visits, and average income were calculated for overview.
3.	Segmentation: Customers were segmented by demographic attributes to identify behavioral patterns in online purchases.
4.	Visualization: An interactive dashboard was created using Power BI to provide at-a-glance insights through bar charts, pie charts, and KPIs.

### Insights
1. Overall Performance:
   - Total purchases stand at 33K with 2,240 customers, generating $760K in revenue and averaging $52.2K in customer income.
   -	Web purchases are significant, driven mainly by customers with higher education levels and specific marital statuses.
2. Campaign Effectiveness:
   -	Campaigns Cmp4 (167) and Cmp5 (163) outperform others in terms of customer response.
3. Product Performance:
   -	Wines are the top-performing product category (681K), followed by Meat (374K) and Gold (99K).
4. Channel Performance:
   -	Web and Deals purchases lead with 13K and 9K transactions respectively, indicating a strong online presence.
5. Demographics & Behavior:
   -	Married individuals and graduates show the highest likelihood of web purchases.
   - Spain and Saudi Arabia dominate in web purchases by country.
   - The older adult group is the largest segment participating in web purchases


### Recommendations
1.	Campaign Optimization: Scale and replicate strategies used in successful campaigns (Cmp4 & Cmp5) across other segments and regions.
2.	Target High-Performing Demographics: Focus marketing spend on married, graduate-level customers in Spain and Saudi Arabia, who are more responsive to online campaigns.
3.	Product Promotion: Emphasize best-selling categories like Wines and Meat in promotions, particularly through web and deals channels.
4.	Channel Investment: Continue investing in digital channels, especially web and deal-based purchases, which show high engagement and return.
